# Andersen DevOps online course 11-12.2021 

## Homework 5
Build a docker container for your python app!
- this time it needs to listen port 8080, HTTP only
- the lighter in terms of image size it is â€“ the more points you get
- the one who builds the smallest image gets even more points!
### Hints:
- use the minimal possible setup  
- 100MB is a lot ;-)
